"""Repository hygiene — traces of one machine must not reach a distribution.

This repository is cloned onto machines that are nothing like the one it was
written on, so anything that only resolves on the author's computer is a defect
there: an absolute home-directory path, a temporary-directory path, a symlink
pointing at something the clone does not contain. None of it fails a build here,
and all of it fails somewhere else — which is why it needs a check rather than a
habit.

The same applies to the by-products of authoring tools. A link to an editing or
chat transcript is only reachable by the person who made it, and an attribution
trailer belongs to the commit metadata, not to a file that ships.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT OWN. Secrets, personal e-mail addresses and non-routable
network addresses belong to ``secret_scan.py``. This scanner matches none of
them, so no line is ever failed by both checks; ``tests/test_hygiene_scan.py``
asserts that split mechanically, in both directions.

FAIL CLOSED. A tracked file that cannot be read or decoded is a FAILURE, not a
skip: "I could not look" and "I looked and it was clean" must not share an exit
code. Tracked files only — what is not tracked is not distributed.

Usage:
    python scripts/hygiene_scan.py [path]   # default: current directory
Exit: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 the scan could not be performed.
