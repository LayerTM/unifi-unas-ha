"""The guard that keeps this integration off deprecated Home Assistant APIs.

`conftest._no_deprecated_ha_api` fails any test in which core reports a
deprecated API used here. A guard is a claim about what it can see, so this
module checks both halves of that claim: that it fires on a real report, and
that the sentences it watches for are still the ones core writes.
