"""TLS trust for a local UniFi console.

A UniFi OS console serves a self-signed certificate, so ordinary CA verification
cannot succeed against one. The historical answer was to switch verification off
entirely, which also switches off any assurance that the host answering is the
console — a plain machine-in-the-middle opening.

This module offers the middle ground and makes it the default: **trust on first
use**. The certificate is read once while the integration is being set up, its
SHA-256 fingerprint is recorded, and every later connection is accepted only if
it presents that exact certificate. A console with a real certificate can still
be verified against the CA store instead.

``aiohttp.Fingerprint`` does the enforcing. Two properties of it matter and both
were read from aiohttp 3.14.3 rather than assumed:

- passing a ``Fingerprint`` as the per-request ``ssl`` argument makes aiohttp use
  its *unverified* SSL context (``TCPConnector._get_ssl_context``), which is what
  lets a self-signed certificate be pinned at all;
- the check runs in ``TCPConnector._create_direct_connection`` immediately after
  the TLS handshake and **before the request is written**, closing the transport
  on mismatch. Credentials therefore never reach an impostor.
