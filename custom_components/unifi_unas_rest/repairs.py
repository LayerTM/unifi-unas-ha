"""Repair flows for the TLS trust of a UniFi UNAS entry.

Two things can go wrong with a pinned certificate, and neither is an
authentication problem, so neither belongs in the reauth flow:

* the console now serves a different certificate — it was reissued, or something
  is impersonating it. Only the user can tell those apart, so both fingerprints
  are shown and accepting the new one is an explicit act.
* the entry predates pinning and still verifies nothing. It keeps working; this
  offers the one-time step that starts pinning.

Both flows obey the same two rules, which pull in opposite directions and are
easy to satisfy one at a time and get wrong together:

1. **Pin only what was shown.** Reading the certificate again on confirmation and
   storing that would record something the user never compared.
2. **Never pin what is no longer served.** A repair can sit in the notification
   list for days; the certificate behind it may be long gone.

So confirmation re-reads the certificate and compares it against the one on
screen: equal, it is pinned; different, the form comes back showing the new one,
and nothing is stored until the user has seen the value being accepted.
